I have been a software architecture enthusiast and problem solver in the .NET world for 10 years.  
For 7 years I have been exploring distributed systems, architecting and developing software solutions, practicing agile and devops.  
3 years ago I entered cloud world (Azure) and never looked back.  
I had a pleasurable affair with IoT.  
Recently I discovered and challenged myself in the Team Lead role.  
In private life I am a father of Four, husband, Golden Retriever owner, drummer, gamer.
